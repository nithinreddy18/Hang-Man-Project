# 🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

A simple **command-line Hangman game** written in Python.  
One player enters a secret word, and the other tries to guess it letter by letter before the hangman is fully drawn.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Two-player mode: one sets the word, the other guesses.  
- ASCII art hangman drawing that updates after each wrong guess.  
- Tracks guessed letters.  
- Input validation (only accepts single lowercase letters).  
- Clears screen after the secret word is entered (so the guesser can’t see it).

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher  
(No external libraries required)
